# Name-based nationality prediction

This is a data analysis repository for the study at https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/.

## Scrape Wikipedia

Names are pulled from Wikipedia's category of Living People. 

`01.get-wikipedia-pages.py` navigates through the multiple pages of the category to allow access to all 900,000+ pages.

`02.scrape-wikipedia.py` actually navigates to individual people's pages, as linked from the living people list, and parses out name and nationality. This step is time-intensive, so parallelization is strongly recommended. This functionality is available via parallelize_wiki.sh.

`03.process-wiki-output` cleans the names returned in step 2 (removing nicknames, common suffixes, etc.) and maps the nationality returned in step 2 to a larger region and subsequent classifier class.

## Build classifier

`04.featurize-names.py` splits the names into a list of n-grams (e.g. "Jane Doe" split into 3-grams becomes the document ["Jan","ane","ne ", "e D", " Do", "Doe"]) which is use as input for the classifier. and splits the wiki data into training and evaluation sets.

`05.train-model.py` builds the LSTM neural network used as a classifier on the training data created in step 4.

`06.evaluate-model.py` returns accuracy metrics as measured on the evaluation set.

## Use classifier

`07.test-ismb-data.py` takes conference speaker and journal author data from https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity (code to produce these data also available in that repo) and runs them through our classifier.
